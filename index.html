			<p class="text">This is a simple website to demonstrate HTML , CSS and HTML5<br>
			class="text">HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages. HTML describes the structure of a Web page. 
				HTML consists of a series of elements. HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content.<br>
				CSS is what makes everything not look like a white background with a bunch of Times New Roman texts and blue hyperlinks. 
				Have you ever tried to load Amazon on a bad day and see nothing but a white page with a huge list of black texts, 
				some blue links and nothing else? Thats Amazon loading without styles. 
				Styles are what transition beautiful designs onto a site. </p>

				CSS determines the style and layout, and JavaScript makes the content interactive; 
					therefore, it makes the most sense to learn them in that order. 
					JavaScript incorporates valuable skills such as object-oriented, 
					functional, and imperative styles of programming.<br>
			HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript are the fundamental Web technologies that all web developers must know. This HTML5, 
				CSS3 and JavaScript Training course is designed to review the basics and leverage modern 
				features to enhance user experience across all devices, 
				from desktop browsers to the latest smartphones and tablets.<br>
				HTML 5 is the fifth and current version of HTML. It has improved the markup available for documents and 
				has introduced application programming interfaces (API) and Document Object Model (DOM). </p>
